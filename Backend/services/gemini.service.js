    Given the following product information:
    Product Title: "${title}"
    Product Description: "${description}"

    Generate the following sections, formatted in Markdown:
    ### âœ¨ Product Overview
    (An engaging and detailed description of the product. Highlight its key features and what makes it special. Use emojis to make it more appealing.)

    ### ðŸš€ How to Use
    (Clear, step-by-step instructions on how to use the product. If it's a simple product, explain its various applications. Use emojis where appropriate.)

    ### ðŸ’– Why You'll Love It
    (A bulleted list of the top 3-5 reasons why a customer should buy this product. Focus on benefits, not just features. Start each bullet point with a '*' and use emojis.)

    Ensure the content is:
    - Original and plagiarism-free.
    - Easy to read: Use short paragraphs, headings, and bullet points.
    - Engaging and persuasive.
    - Sounds like it was written by a human expert.
